     * opted for an explicit notion of state-bearing objects.
     *
     * Below are two state objects. Their class names are not essential, it
     * matters they are marked with @State. These objects will be instantiated
     * on demand, and reused during the entire benchmark trial.
     *
     * The important property is that state is always instantiated by one of
     * those benchmark threads which will then have the access to that state.
     * That means you can initialize the fields as if you do that in worker
     * threads (ThreadLocals are yours, etc).
